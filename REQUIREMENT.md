Test 2:

1. Front-End - NextJS
   This should have a single-page component with a table view. This table should have the following columns, sortable, and searchable (implement a search box and other required components for functionality):

- user name
- email
- phone
- LinkedIn profile URL- company name

2. Back-End:

- Setup a simple GraphQL Back-End with a single query to fetch the data from a MongoDB Back-End (you can use Atlas free-tier for the hosting)

This should include front-end and back-end technologies. Also, it does not have to be limited to javascript if you have other skill sets.

Tips for Test#2:
Consider a production-sized dataset of million results. Pagination and sort logic need to be tackled wisely.
